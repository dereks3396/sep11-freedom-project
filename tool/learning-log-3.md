# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Kaboom**

## Project: **Parkour Game**

---

### 11/11/25:
* Make a new mini project imported from kaboom
* Copy [sprite's](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=sprite) code and replace it with bean instead of sprite
* from this: [Sprite](Sprite.png)
* to this: [Bean](Bean.png)
* Removed the frames because bean is not animated like sprite is so it just crashed the site
* Set animations like *idle* and *run* to 0 because [bean](ide-anims.png) is not animated like [sprite](kaboom-anims.png).
